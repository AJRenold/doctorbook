                    structure.</emphasis></phrase> Organizing is such a common activity that we
            often do it without thinking much about it. We organize the shoes in our closet, the
            books on our book shelves, the spices in our kitchen, and the folders into which we file
            information for tax and other purposes. Quite a few of us have jobs that involve
            specific types of organizing tasks. We might even have been explicitly trained to
            perform them by following specialized disciplinary practices. We might learn to do these
            tasks very well, but even then we often do not reflect on the similarity of the
            organizing tasks we do and those done by others, or on the similarity of those we do at
            work and those we do at home. We take for granted and as givens the concepts and methods
            used in the Organizing System we work with most often.</para>
        <para>The goal of this book is to help readers become more self-conscious about what it

            printed books and shoes or digital resources like web pages and MP3

        <para>This book evolved from a master's level university course on <quote>Information
                Organization &amp; Retrieval</quote> I taught for several years at the <firstterm
                id="first_UCBiSchool"><orgname xreflabel="University of California, Berkeley"
                    >University of California, Berkeley</orgname>'s <orgname>School of
                    Information</orgname></firstterm>. My goal was to synthesize insights from
                <phrase>library science</phrase>, <phrase>information science</phrase>,
                <phrase>cognitive science</phrase>, <phrase>systems analysis</phrase>, and
                <phrase>computer science</phrase> to provide my students with a richer understanding
            about <phrase>information organization</phrase> than any discipline alone could provide.
            I came to realize that information was just one of the many types of resources to
            organize and that it would be beneficial to think about the <phrase>art and science of
                organizing</phrase> in a more abstract way. This book is the product of countless
            discussions with students and faculty colleagues at <orgname>Berkeley</orgname> and
            other schools, and we are collaboratively developing a new discipline that unifies four
            types of organizing, as follows:</para>
        <para><emphasis role="strong">We organize physical things.</emphasis> Each of us organizes
            many kinds of <hardware>things</hardware> in our lives<symbol>&#8212;</symbol>our books
            on bookshelves; printed financial records in folders and filing cabinets; clothes in
            dressers and closets; cooking and eating utensils in kitchen drawers and cabinets.
            Public libraries organize printed books, periodicals, maps, CDs, DVDs, and maybe some
            old record albums. Research libraries also organize rare manuscripts, pamphlets, musical
            scores, and many other kinds of printed information. Museums organize paintings,
            sculptures, and other artifacts of cultural, historical, or scientific value. Stores and
            suppliers organize their goods for sale to consumers and to each other.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">We organize information about physical things.</emphasis> Each
            of us organizes information about things, when we inventory the <hardware>contents of
                our house</hardware> for insurance purposes, when we sell our <hardware>unwanted
                stuff</hardware> on eBay, or when we rate a restaurant on
                <application>Yelp</application>. Library card catalogs, and their online
            replacements, tell us what books a library's collection contains and where to find them.
                <hardware>Sensors</hardware> and <hardware>RFID tags</hardware> track the movement
            of goods<symbol>&#8212;</symbol>even library books<symbol>&#8212;</symbol>through supply
            chains, and the movement (or lack of movement) of <hardware>cars</hardware> on
            highways.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="strong">We organize digital things</emphasis>. Each of us organizes
            personal digital information<symbol>&#8212;</symbol>email, documents, e-books, MP3 and
            video files, appointments, and contacts<symbol>&#8212;</symbol>on our computers, smart
            phone, e-book readers or in <quote>the cloud,</quote> through information services that
            use Internet protocols. Large research libraries organize digital journals and books,
            computer programs, government and scientific datasets, databases, and many other kinds
            of digital information. Companies organize their digital business records and customer
            information in enterprise applications, content repositories, and databases. Hospitals
            and medical clinics maintain and exchange electronic health records and digital X-rays
            and scans.</para>
        <para><indexterm>
                <primary>digital library</primary>
            </indexterm><emphasis role="strong">We organize information about digital
                things</emphasis>. Digital library catalogs, web portals and aggregation websites
            organize links to other digital resources. Web search engines use content and link
            analysis along with relevance ratings to organize the billions of web pages competing
            for our attention. Web-based services, data feeds and other information resources can be
            combined as <quote>mash-ups</quote> or choreographed to carry out information-intensive
            business models.</para>
        <para>Let's take a closer look at these four different types or contexts of organizing. Are
            there clear, systematic and useful distinctions between them? We contrasted
                <quote>organizing things</quote> with <quote>organizing information.</quote> At
            first glance it might seem that organizing physical things like books, compact discs,
            machine parts, or cooking utensils has an entirely different character than organizing
            intangible digital things. We often arrange physical things according to their shapes,
            sizes, material of manufacture, or other visible properties; for example, we might
            arrange our shirts in the clothes closet by style and color, and we might organize our
            music collection by separating the old vinyl albums from the CDs. We might arrange books
            on bookshelves by their sizes, putting all the big heavy picture books on the bottom
            shelf. Organization for clothes and information artifacts in tangible formats that is
            based on visible properties does not seem much like how you store and organize digital
            books on your Kindle or arrange digital music on your music player. Arranging, storing,
            and accessing X-rays printed on film might appear to have little in common with these
            activities when the X-rays are in digital form.</para>
        <para>It is hardly surprising that organizing things and organizing information sometimes do
            not differ much when information is represented in a tangible way. The era of ubiquitous
            digital information of the last decade or two is just a blip in time compared with the
            more than ten thousand years of human experience with information carved in stone,
            etched in clay, or printed with ink on papyrus, parchment or paper. These tangible
            information artifacts have deeply embedded the notion of information as a physical thing
            in culture, language, and methods of information design and organization. This
            perspective toward tangible information artifacts is especially prominent in rare book
            collections where books are revered as physical objects with a focus on their
            distinctive binding, calligraphy, and typesetting.</para>
        <para>Nevertheless, at other times there are substantial differences in how we organize
            things and how we organize information, even when the latter is in physical form. We
            more often organize our <quote>information things</quote> according to what they are
            about rather than on the basis of their visible properties. At home we sort our CDs by
            artist or genre; we keep cookbooks separate from travel books, and fiction books apart
            from reference books. Libraries employ subject-based classification schemes that have a
            few hundred thousand distinct categories.</para>
        <para>Likewise, there are times when we pay little attention to the visible properties of
            tangible things when we organize them and instead arrange them according to functional
            or task properties. We keep screwdrivers, pliers, a hammer, a saw, a drill, and a level
            in a tool box or together on a work bench, even though they have few visual properties
            in common. We are not organizing them because of what we see about them, but because of
            what we know about to use them, The task-based organization of the tools has some
            similarity to the subject-based organization of the library.</para>
        <para>We also contrasted <quote>organizing things</quote> with <quote>organizing information
                about things.</quote> This difference seems clear if we consider the traditional
            library card catalog, whose printed cards describe and specify the location of books on
            library shelves. When the things and the information about them are both in physical
            format, it is easy to see that the former is a primary resource and the latter a
            surrogate or associated resource that describes or relates to it.</para>

            <title>What Is Information?</title>
            <para>Geoff Nunberg has eloquently explained in <link linkend="Nunberg1996"><citetitle
                        pubwork="book">Farewell to the Information Age</citetitle></link> that
                    <quote>Information</quote> is <quote>a collection of notions, rather than a
                    single coherent concept.</quote> Most of its hundreds of definitions treat it as
                an idea that swirls around equally hard-to-define terms like <quote>data,</quote>
                <quote>knowledge,</quote> and <quote>communication.</quote> Moreover, these
                intellectual and ideological perspectives on information coexist with more mundane
                uses of the term, as when we ask a station agent: <quote>Can you give me some
                    information about the train schedule?</quote></para>
            <para>An abstract view of information as an intangible thing is the intellectual
                foundation for both modern information science and the information economy and
                society. Nevertheless, the abstract view of information often conflicts with the
                much older idea that information is a tangible thing that naturally arose when
                information was inextricably encoded in material formats. We often blur the sense of
                    <quote>information as content</quote> with the sense of <quote>information as
                    container,</quote> and we too easily treat the number of stored bits on a
                computer or in <quote>the cloud</quote> as a measure of information content or
                value.</para>

                    <surname>Buckland</surname>
                </personname>'s oft-cited essay <link linkend="Buckland1991"><citetitle
                        pubwork="journal">Information as Thing</citetitle></link> rebuts the notion
                that information is inherently intangible and instead defines it more broadly and
                provocatively based on function. This makes the objects in museum or personal
                collections into information-as-thing resources because they can be learned from and
                serve as evidence.<footnote id="chapter-1-endnote-01" role="Citation">

        <para>When it comes to <quote>organizing information about digital things</quote> the
            contrast is much less clear, When you search for a book using a search engine, first you
            get the catalog description of the book, and if you're lucky the book itself is just a
            click away. When the things and the information about them are both digital, the
            contrast we posed is not as sharp as when one or both of them is in a physical format.
            And while we used X-rays<symbol>&#8212;</symbol>on film or in digital
                format<symbol>&#8212;</symbol>as examples of things we might organize, when a
            physician studies an X-ray, is it not being used as information about the subject of the
            X-ray, namely the patient?</para>
        <para>These differences and relationships between <quote><emphasis role="strong">physical
                    things</emphasis></quote> and <quote><emphasis role="strong">digital
                    things</emphasis></quote> have long been discussed and debated by philosophers,
            linguists, psychologists and others (See the Sidebar, <xref
                linkend="chapter-1-sidebar-1"/>).</para>
        <para>The distinctions among organizing physical things, organizing digital
            things, or organizing information about physical things or digital things are
            challenging to describe because many of the words we might use are as overloaded with
            multiple meanings as information itself. For example, some people use the term
                <quote>document</quote> to refer only to traditional physical forms, while others
            use it more abstractly to refer to any self-contained unit of information independent of
            its instantiation in physical or digital form.

            </indexterm>The most abstract definition, presented
            in <citetitle pubwork="journal">What is a Document?</citetitle> is when Buckland
            provocatively asserts that an antelope is both <quote>information as thing</quote> and
            also a <quote>document</quote> when it is in a zoo, even though it is just an animal
            when it is running wild on the plains of Africa. Similar definitional variation occurs

            this book is to bridge the intellectual gulf that separates the many disciplines that
            share the goal of organizing but that differ in what they organize. This requires us to
            focus on situations where information exists because of intentional acts to create or
            organize.</para>
        <para> Many of the foundational topics for a discipline of organizing have traditionally
            been presented from the perspective of the public sector library and taught as
                <quote>library and information science.</quote> These include bibliographic
            description, classification, naming, authority control, and information standards. We
            need to update and extend the coverage of these topics to include more private sector
            and non-bibliographic contexts, multi- and social-media, and new information-intensive
            applications and service systems enabled by mobile, pervasive, and scientific computing.
            In so doing we can reframe the foundational concepts to make them equally compatible
            with the disciplinary perspectives of informatics, data and process modeling, and
            document engineering.</para>
        <para>We also need to take a transdisciplinary view that lets us emphasize what the
            different disciplines have in common rather than what distinguishes them. Resource
            selection, organizing, interaction design, and maintenance are taught in every
            discipline, but these concepts go by different names. A vocabulary for discussing common
            organizing challenges and issues that might be otherwise obscured by narrow disciplinary
            perspectives helps us understand existing systems of organizing better while also
            suggesting how to invent new ones by making different design choices. </para>

                disciplines have only limited agreement in how they approach problems of organizing
                and in what they seek as their solutions. For example, library and information

                perspective, paying careful attention to user requirements for access and
                preservation, and offering prescriptive methods and solutions.<footnote

                involves a collection of resources, and we can treat physical things, digital
                things, and information about such things as resources. Every system of organization
                involves a choice of properties or principles used to describe and arrange the
                resources, and ways of supporting interactions with the resources. By comparing and
                contrasting how these activities take place in different contexts and domains, we
                can identify patterns of organizing and see that Organizing Systems often follow a

        <para>An Organizing System is an abstract characterization of how some collection of
            resources is described and arranged to enable human or computational agents to interact
            with the resources. The Organizing System is an architectural and conceptual view that
            is distinct from the physical arrangement of resources that might embody it, and also
            distinct from the person, enterprise, or institution that implements and operates it.
            These distinctions are sometimes hard to maintain in ordinary language; for example, we
            might describe some set of resource descriptions, organizing principles, and supported
            interactions as a <quote>library</quote> Organizing System. However, we also need at
            times to refer to a <quote>library</quote> as the institution in which this Organizing
            System operates, and of course the idea of a <quote>library</quote> as a physical
            facility is deeply engrained in language and culture.</para>

            information, the more effectively it can be retrieved, and the more effort put into
            retrieving information, the less it needs to be organized first. A systems view no
            longer contrasts information organization as a human activity and information retrieval
            as a machine activity, or information organization as a topic for library and
            information science and information retrieval as one for computer science. Instead, we
            readily see that computers now assist people in organizing and that people contribute

                more broadly at Organizing Systems, it is often difficult to distinguish between the
                resource being described and any description of it or associated with it. One
                challenge is that when descriptions are embedded in resources, as metadata often is
                in the title page of a book, in the masthead of a newspaper, or in the source of web
                pages, deciding which resources are primary is often arbitrary. A second challenge
                is that what serves as a metadata for one person or process can function as a
                primary resource or data for another one. Rather than being an inherent distinction,
                the difference between primary and associated resources is often just a decision
                about which resource we are focusing on in some situation. An animal specimen in a
                natural history museum might be a <glossterm linkend="gloss_primary_resource"
                    >primary resource</glossterm> for museum visitors and scientists interested in
                anatomy, but information about where the specimen was collected is the <glossterm
                    linkend="gloss_primary_resource">primary resource</glossterm> for scientists
                interested in ecology or migration.</para>
            <para>Organizing Systems can refer to people as resources, and we often use that term to
                avoid specifying the gender or specific role of an employee or worker, as in the
                management concept of the <quote>human resources</quote> or HR department in a firm.
                The shift from a manufacturing to an information and services economy in the last
                few decades has resulted in greater emphasis on intellectual resources represented
                in skills and knowledge rather than on the natural resources of production materials

                excludes those systems from our definition of Organizing System. These
                self-organizing systems have been used in physics, chemistry, and mathematics to
                explain phase transitions and equilibrium states. Self-organizing is also used to
                describe numerous natural and man-made phenomena like climate, communication
                networks, business and biological ecosystems, traffic and habitation patterns,
                neural networks, and online communities. All of these systems involve collections of
                resources that are very large and open, with complex interactions among the
                resources. The resource arrangements that emerge cannot always be interpreted as the
                result of intentional or deterministic principles and instead are more often
                described in probabilistic or statistical terms. <personname>

                    of organizing systems that each embody a separate intentional arrangement of web
                    pages. In addition, we most often interact with the web indirectly by using a
                    search engine, which meets the definition of <glossterm
                        linkend="gloss_organizing_system">Organizing System</glossterm> because its

                are the result of decisions about what is organized, why it is organized, how much

                these will be discussed in greater detail in <xref linkend="section-1.3"/>). An
                Organizing System is defined by the composite impact of the choices made on these

                    modern but many of the principles that govern their organization are those that
                    have influenced the design of Organizing Systems for thousands of years. For
                    example, we organize resources using easily perceived properties to make them
                    easy to locate, we group together resources that we often use together, and we
                    make resources that we use often more accessible than those we use infrequently.
                    Very general and abstract organizing principles are sometimes called design
                    heuristics (for example, <quote>make things easier to find</quote>). More

                <para>Expressing organizing principles in a way that separates design and

                    business logic (intentional arrangement), and data (resources). (See the

                    </indexterm>The logical separation between organizing principles and their
                    implementation is easy to see with digital resources. In a digital library it
                    does not matter to a user if the resources are stored locally or retrieved over
                    a network. The essence of a library Organizing System emerges from the resources
                    that it organizes and the interactions with the resources that it enables. Users
                    typically care a lot about the interactions they can perform, like the kinds of
                    searching and sorting allowed by the online library catalog. How the resources
                    and interactions are implemented are typically of little concern. Similarly,
                    many email applications have migrated to the web and the system of filters and
                    folders that manage email messages is no longer implemented in a local network
                    or on personal computers, but most people neither notice nor care.</para>
                <para>The separation of organizing principles and their implementation is harder to
                    recognize in an Organizing System that only contains <hardware>physical

                        <hardware>clothes closet</hardware>, where you appear to have unmediated

                        tier.</quote> Nevertheless, you can see these different tiers in the
                    organization of <hardware>spices in a kitchen</hardware>. Different kitchens
                    might all embody an <glossterm linkend="gloss_alphabetical">alphabetic
                        order</glossterm> organizing principle for arranging a collection of spices,
                    but the exact locations and arrangement of the spices in any particular kitchen
                    depends on the configuration of shelves and drawers, whether a spice rack or
                    rotating tray is used, and other storage-tier considerations. Similarly, spices
                    could be logically organized by cuisine, with Indian spices separated from
                    Mexican spices, but this organizing principle does not imply anything about
                    where they can be found in the kitchen.</para>

                    <title>The Three Tiers of Organizing Systems</title>
                    <para>Software architects and designers agree that it is desirable to build
                        applications that separate the storage of data, the business logic or
                        functions that use the data, and the user interface or presentation
                        components through which users or other applications interact with the data.
                        This modular architecture allows each of the three tiers to be upgraded or
                        reimplemented independently to satisfy changed requirements or to take
                        advantage of new technologies. An analogous distinction is that between an
                        algorithm as a logical description of a method for solving a computational
                        problem and its implementation in a particular programming language like <citerefentry>
                            <refentrytitle>Java</refentrytitle>
                        </citerefentry> or <citerefentry>
                            <refentrytitle>Python</refentrytitle>
                        </citerefentry>.</para>
                    <para>These architectural distinctions are equally important to librarians and
                        information scientists. Our new way of looking at Organizing Systems
                        emphasizes the importance of identifying the desired interactions with
                        resources, determining which organizing principles can enable the
                        interactions, and then deciding how to store and manage the resources
                        according to those principles. Applying architectural thinking to Organizing
                        Systems makes it easier to compare and contrast existing ones and design new
                        ones. Separating the organizing principles in the <quote>middle tier</quote>
                        from their implications in the <quote>data</quote> and
                            <quote>presentation</quote> tiers often makes it possible to implement
                        the same logical Organizing System in different environments that support
                        the same or equivalent interactions with the resources. For example, a new
                        requirement to support searching through a library catalog on a smart phone
                        would only affect the presentation tier.</para>

                    presentation, logic, and storage tiers for four different types of library
                    Organizing Systems and for Books. No two of them are the same in every tier.
                    Note how a library that uses inventory robots to manage the storage of books
                    does not reveal this in its higher tiers.</para>

                            because they differ greatly in the time they take to complete and the
                            storage space they require. For example, if the collection is arranged
                            in an unorganized or random manner (as a <quote>pile</quote>) and every
                            resource must be examined, the time to find a particular item increases
                            linearly with the collection size. If the collection is maintained in an
                            ordered manner, a binary search algorithm can locate any item in a time
                            proportional to the logarithm of the number of items. Analysis of

                        clothes closet, the resources you use most often migrate to the front
                        because that is the easiest place to return them after using them.</phrase>
                    But as a collection grows in size, the time to arrange, locate, and retrieve a
                    particular resource becomes more important. The collection must be explicitly
                    organized to make these interactions efficient, and the organization must be
                    preserved after the interaction takes place; i.e., resources are put back in the
                    place they were found. As a result, most Organizing Systems employ organizing
                    principles that make use of properties of the resources being organized (for
                    example, name, color, shape, date of creation, semantic or biological category),
                    and multiple properties are often used simultaneously. For example, in your
                    kitchen you might arrange your <hardware>cooking pots</hardware> and pans by
                        <hardware>size and shape</hardware> so you can nest them and store them
                    compactly, but you might also arrange things by cuisine or style and separate
                    your grilling equipment from the wok and other items you use for making Chinese
                    food.</para>
                <para>Unlike those for physical resources, the most useful organizing properties for
                    information resources are those based on their content and meaning, and these
                    are not directly apparent when you look at a book or document. Significant
                    intellectual effort or computation is necessary to reveal these properties when
                    assigning subject terms or creating an index. The most effective organizing
                    systems for information resources often are based on properties that emerge from
                    analyzing the collection as a whole. For example, the relevance of documents to
                    a search query is higher when they contain a higher than average frequency of
                    the query terms compared to other documents in the collection, or when they are
                    linked to relevant documents. Likewise, algorithms for classifying email
                    messages continuously recalculate the probability that words like
                        <quote>beneficiary</quote> or <quote>Viagra</quote> indicate whether a
                    message is <quote>spam</quote> or <quote>not spam</quote> in the collection of
                    messages processed.</para>

                <title>The Digital Zoo</title>
                <para>Consider the Organizing System of a zoo, which typically organizes
                    the <hardware>physical resources</hardware> that we usually call
                        <hardware>animals</hardware> according to principles of biological taxonomy
                    or common habitat. The most important interaction supported by a modern zoo is
                    enabling visitors to <action>observe</action> the behavior of animals in
                    environments resembling their natural environments.</para>
                <para>If all the animals are <quote>stored</quote> in a single location and we
                    prefer unmediated interaction with them, the physical requirements for housing
                    and showcasing the animals and our own mobility limits how big a zoo can be.
                    However, this is simply a conventional manner of storing the animals and
                    supporting interactions with them.</para>
                <para>We can imagine a <quote>digital zoo</quote> in which all of the
                    world's zoos are treated as a single digital collection. Instead of physical
                    co-presence to enable viewing of the animals, <quote>telepresence</quote>
                    quality video camera connections to zoo exhibits would enable us to view animals
                    in the San Diego, Berlin, Singapore, Toronto and other great zoos from our
                    living rooms almost as if we were there. Instead of a walk from exhibit to
                    exhibit, a tour of a digital zoo would be implemented as a list of video
                    connections, and different tours implemented as different sequences of cameras.
                    Sensors in each animal habitat could detect activity and image recognition
                    software could classify the behavior, enabling us to search the combined zoo for
                    particular combinations of active animals to view (e.g., a mother and infant
                    chimpanzee). No zoo would need to change how it <quote>stores</quote> the
                    animals to enable these new principles of organization and our new kinds of
                    interactions with them.</para>
            </sidebar>
            <para>Some of the interactions with resources in an Organizing System are inherently
                determined by the characteristics of the resource. Because many museum resources are
                unique or extremely valuable, visitors are allowed to <action>view</action> them but
                cannot <action>borrow</action> them, in contrast with most of the resources in
                libraries. A library might have multiple printed copies of <citetitle pubwork="book"
                    >Moby Dick</citetitle> but can never lend more of them than it possesses. After
                a printed book is checked out from the library, there are many types of interactions
                that might take place<symbol>&#8212;</symbol><action>reading</action>,
                    <action>translating</action>, <action>summarizing</action>,

                marginal cost of allowing another access is nearly zero. Furthermore, with digital
                resources many new kinds of interactions can be enabled through application

                Organizing System. In particular, translation, summarization, annotation, and
                keyword suggestion are highly useful services that are commonly supported by web
                search engines and other web applications. Similarly, an Organizing System with
                digital resources can implement a <quote>keep everything up to date</quote>
                interaction that automatically pushes current content to your browser or computing

        <title>Design Decisions in Organizing Systems</title>
        <para>A set of resources is transformed by an Organizing System when the resources are
            described or arranged to enable interactions with them. Explicitly or by default, this
            requires many interdependent decisions about the identities of resources; their names,
            descriptions and other properties; the classes, relations, structures and collections in
            which they participate; and the people or technologies who interact with them.</para>
        <para>One important contribution of the idea of the Organizing System is that it moves
            beyond the debate about the definitions of things, documents, and information with the
            unifying concept of resource while acknowledging that <quote>what is being
                organized</quote> is just one of the questions or dimensions that need to be
            considered.</para>
        <para>These decisions are deeply intertwined, but it is easier to introduce them as if they
            were independent. We introduce five groups of design decisions, itemizing the most
            important dimensions in each group:</para>

                        things</hardware>, digital things, and information about things in the
                    Organizing System? Is the Organizing System being designed to enable a resource
                    collection to be created, for an existing and closed resource collection, or for
                    a collection in which resources are continually added or deleted? Are the
                    resources unique, or are they interchangeable members of a class? Do they follow
                    a predictable <quote>life cycle</quote> with a <quote>useful

                    Does the Organizing System need to satisfy personal, social, or institutional

                    a centralized or top-down manner or in a distributed or bottom-up manner? What

                    time, all the time? Is any of this organizing mandated by law or shaped by

            these constraints and tradeoffs are handled can depend on the legal, business and
            technological contexts in which the Organizing System is designed and deployed; on the
            relationship between the designers and users of the Organizing System (who may be the
            same people or different ones); on the economic or emotional or societal purpose of the
            Organizing System; and on numerous other design, deployment, and use factors.</para>

            <para>Classifying Organizing Systems according to the kind of resources they contain is
                the most obvious and traditional approach. We can also classify Organizing Systems
                by their dominant purposes, by their intended user community, or other ways. No
                single fixed set of categories is sufficient by itself to capture the commonalities
                and contrasts between Organizing Systems.</para>
            <para>We can augment the categorical view of Organizing Systems by thinking of them as
                existing in a multi-faceted or multi-dimensional design space in which we can
                consider many types of collections are at the same time.</para>

                <title>Conventional Ways to Classify Organizing Systems</title>
                <para>We distinguish law libraries from software libraries, knowledge management
                    systems from data warehouses, and personal <hardware>stamp
                        collections</hardware> from <hardware>coin collections</hardware> primarily
                    because they contain different kinds of resources. Similarly, we distinguish
                        <hardware>document collections</hardware> by resource type, contrasting
                    narrative document types like novels and biographies with transactional ones
                    like catalogs and invoices, with hybrid forms like textbooks and encyclopedias
                    in between.</para>
                <para>But there are three other conventional ways to classify Organizing Systems. A
                    second way to distinguish Organizing Systems is by their dominant purposes or
                    the priority of their common purposes. For example, libraries, museums, and
                    archives are often classified as <quote>memory institutions</quote> to emphasize
                    their primary emphasis on resource preservation. In contrast, <quote>management
                        information systems</quote> or <quote>business systems</quote> are
                    categories that include the great variety of software applications that
                    implement the Organizing Systems needed to carry out day-to-day business
                    operations.</para>
                <para>A third conventional approach for classifying Organizing Systems is according
                    to the nature or size of the intended user community. This size or scope can
                    range from personal Organizing Systems created and used by a single person; to
                        <quote>community-based</quote> Organizing Systems used by informal social
                    groups; to those used by the employees, customers or stakeholders of an
                    enterprise; to those used by an entire community or nation; to global ones
                    potentially used by anyone in the world.</para>
                <para>A fourth way to distinguish Organizing Systems is according to the technology
                    used to implement them. Large businesses use different software applications for
                    inventory management, records management, content management, knowledge
                    management, customer relationship management, data warehousing and business
                    intelligence, e-mail archiving, and other subcategories of collections.<footnote

                            </indexterm>Sometimes many of these Organizing Systems and their
                            associated applications are implemented using a unified storage
                            foundation provided by an <application>enterprise content management
                                    (<abbrev>ECM</abbrev>)</application> or <application>enterprise
                                data management (<abbrev>EDM</abbrev>)</application> system. An

                <para>We can become overwhelmed by this proliferation of ways to classify
                    collections of resources, especially when the classification is not clearly
                    based on just one of these many approaches. For example, the list of

                        of Library Associations</orgname> to organize its activities includes
                    resource-based distinctions (e.g. art libraries, law libraries, social science
                    libraries), purpose-based ones (e.g., academic and research libraries), and
                    user-based distinctions (e.g., public libraries, school libraries, libraries
                    serving persons with print disabilities).<footnote id="chapter-1-endnote-15"

                    </indexterm>A type of resource and its conventional Organizing System are often
                    the focal point of a discipline. Category labels like library, museum, zoo, and
                    data repository have core meanings and many associated experiences and
                    practices. Specialized concepts and vocabularies often evolve to describe these.
                    The richness that follows from this complex social and cultural construction
                    makes it difficult to define category boundaries precisely. Consider Borgman's
                    commonly accepted definition of libraries as institutions that <quote>select,
                        collect, organize, conserve, preserve, and provide access to information on
                        behalf of a community of users.</quote> Many Organizing Systems are
                    described as libraries, although they differ from traditional libraries in
                    important respects. See <xref linkend="chapter-1-sidebar-6" xrefstyle="short"

                <para>We can always create new categories by stretching the conventional definitions
                    of <quote>library</quote> or other familiar Organizing Systems and adding
                    modifiers, as when <application>Flickr</application> is described as a web-based
                    photo-sharing library. But whenever we define an Organizing System with respect
                    to a familiar category, the typical or mainstream instances and characteristics
                    of that category that are deeply embedded in language and culture are
                    reinforced, and those that are atypical are marginalized. In the
                        <application>Flickr</application> case this means we suggest features that
                    are not there (like authoritative classification) or omit the features that are
                    distinctive (like tagging by users).</para>
                <para>More generally, a categorical view of Organizing Systems makes it matter
                    greatly which category is used to anchor definitions or comparisons. The
                        <application>Google Books</application> project makes out-of-print and
                    scholarly works vastly more accessible, but framing it in library terms to
                    suggest it is a public good upsets many people with a more traditional sense of
                    what the library category implies. We can readily identify design choices in
                        <application>Google Books</application> that are more characteristic of the
                    Organizing Systems in business domains, and the project might have been
                    perceived more favorably had it been described as an online bookstore that
                    offered many beneficial services for free.</para>
                <para>A complementary perspective on Organizing Systems is that they exist in a
                    multi-faceted or multi-dimensional design space. This <glossterm
                        linkend="gloss_framework">framework</glossterm> for describing and comparing
                    Organizing Systems overcomes some of the biases and conservatism built into
                    familiar categories like libraries, museums, and archives, while enabling us to
                    describe them as design patterns that embody characteristic configurations of
                    design choices. We can then use these patterns to support multi-disciplinary
                    work that cuts across categories and applies knowledge about familiar domains to
                    unfamiliar ones. A dimensional perspective makes it easier to translate between
                    category and discipline-specific vocabularies so that people from different
                    disciplines can have mutually intelligible discussions about their organizing
                    activities. They might realize that they have much in common, and they might be
                    working on similar or even the same problems.</para>
                <para>A faceted or dimensional perspective acknowledges the diversity of instances
                    of collection types and provides a generative, forward-looking framework for
                    describing hybrid types that do not cleanly fit into the familiar categories.
                    Even though it might differ from the conventional categories on some dimensions,
                    an Organizing System can be designed and understood by its <quote>family
                        resemblance</quote> on the basis of its similarities on other dimensions to
                    a familiar type of resource collection.</para>
                <para>Thinking of Organizing Systems as points or regions in a design space makes it
                    easier to invent new or more specialized types of collections and their
                    associated interactions. If we think metaphorically of this design space as a
                    map of Organizing Systems, the empty regions or <quote>white space</quote>
                    between the densely-populated centers of the traditional categories represent
                    Organizing Systems that do not yet exist. We can consider the properties of an
                    Organizing System that could occupy that white space and analyze the technology,
                    process, or policy innovations that might be required to let us build it there.

                unique item, as one of many equivalent members of a broad category, or as component
                of an item rather than as an item on its own. For example, in a museum collection, a
                    <hardware>handmade carved chess piece</hardware> might be a separately
                identified item, identified as part of a <hardware>set of carved chess
                    pieces</hardware>, or treated as one of the 33 unidentified components of an
                item identified as a chess set (including the board). When merchants assign a
                stock-keeping unit (<abbrev>SKU</abbrev>) to identify the things they sell, an
                    <abbrev>SKU</abbrev> can be associated with a unique item, to sets of items
                treated as equivalent for inventory or billing purposes, or to intangible things
                like warranties.</para>
            <para>You probably do not have explicit labels on the cabinets and drawers in your
                kitchen or clothes closet, but department stores and warehouses have
                    <hardware>signs</hardware> in the aisles and on the shelves because of the
                larger number of things a store needs to organize. As a collection of resources
                grows, it often becomes necessary to identify each one explicitly; to create
                surrogates like bibliographic records or descriptions that distinguish one resource
                from another; and to create additional organizational mechanisms like
                    <hardware>shelf labels</hardware>, <hardware>store directories</hardware>,
                    <hardware>library card catalogs</hardware> and <hardware>indexes</hardware> that
                facilitate understanding the collection and locating the resources it contains.
                These organizational mechanisms often suggest or parallel the organizing principles
                used to organize the collection itself.</para>
            <para>Organization mechanisms like <hardware>aisle signs</hardware>, store directories
                and library card catalogs are embedded in the same physical environment as the
                resources being organized. But when these mechanisms or surrogates are digitized,
                the new capabilities that they enable create design challenges. This is because a
                digital Organizing System can be designed and operated according to more abstract
                and less constraining principles than an Organizing System that only contains
                physical resources. A single physical resource can only be in one
                    <hardware>place</hardware> at a time, and interactions with it are constrained
                by its <hardware>size</hardware>, <hardware>location</hardware>, and other
                properties. In contrast, digital copies and surrogates can exist in many places at
                once and enable searching, sorting, and other interactions with an efficiency and
                scale impossible for tangible things.</para>
            <para>When the resources being organized consist of information content, deciding on the
                unit of organization is challenging because it might be necessary to look beyond
                physical properties and consider conceptual or intellectual equivalence. A high
                school student told to study Shakespeare's play <citetitle>Macbeth</citetitle> might
                treat any printed copy or web version as equivalent, and might even try to outwit
                the teacher by watching a film adaptation of the play. To the student, all versions
                of <citetitle>Macbeth</citetitle> seem to be the same resource, but librarians and
                scholars make much finer distinctions.<footnote id="chapter-1-endnote-19" role="LIS">

            <para>Some Organizing Systems contain legal, business or scientific documents or data
                that are the digital descendants of paper reports or records of transactions or
                observations. These Organizing Systems might need to deal with legacy information
                that still exists in paper form or in electronic formats like image scans that are
                different from the structural digital format in which more recent information is
                likely to be preserved. When legacy conversions from printed information artifacts
                are complete or unnecessary, an Organizing System no longer deals with any of the
                traditional <hardware>tangible artifacts</hardware>. Digital libraries dispense with
                these artifacts, replacing them with the capability to print copies if needed. This
                enables libraries of digital documents or data collections to be vastly larger and
                more accessible across space and time than any library that stores tangible,
                physical items could ever be.</para>
            <para>An increasing number of Organizing Systems handle resources that are born digital.
                Ideally, digital texts can be encoded with explicit markup that captures structural
                boundaries and content distinctions, which can be used to facilitate organization,
                retrieval, or both. In practice the digital representations of texts are often just
                image scans that do not support much processing or interaction. A similar situation
                exists for the digital representations of music, photographs, videos, and other
                non-text content like sensor data, where the digital formats are structurally and

            <para>Almost by definition, the essential purpose of any Organizing System is to
                describe or arrange resources so they can be located and accessed later. The
                organizing principles needed to achieve this goal depend on the types of resources
                or domains being organized, and in the personal, social, or institutional setting in
                which organization takes place. <quote>Bringing like things together</quote> is an
                informal organizing principle for many Organizing Systems. But there will likely be
                a number of more precise requirements or constraints to satisfy.</para>
            <para>Organizing Systems involving <hardware>physical resources</hardware> are more
                likely to emphasize aesthetic or emotional goals than those for information
                resources, which more often are dominated by functional goals like
                    <hardware>efficiency of storage</hardware> and <hardware>access</hardware>. This
                contrast is often magnified by the tendency for major library and museum collections
                to be housed in buildings designed as architectural monuments that over time become
                symbols of national or cultural identity.</para>

                characteristics in common reflect subtle differences in the priority of their shared
                goals. For example, many Organizing Systems create collections and enable
                interactions with the goals of supporting scientific research, public education, and
                entertainment. We can contrast zoos, animal theme parks, and wild animal preserves
                in terms of the absolute and relative importance of these three goals with respect
                to animal resources.<footnote id="chapter-1-endnote-21a" role="CogSci">

                        live animals, so we might conclude that they are more similar to each other

                vary greatly. This is in part because the content of the resources being organized
                becomes a consideration. Furthermore, many of the Organizing Systems used by
                individuals are implemented by web applications, and this makes them more accessible
                because their resources can be accessed from anywhere with a web browser.<footnote

                    <para>[Computing] For example, many people manage their digital photos with

                        <quote>toread,</quote> or <quote>buythis</quote> clearly demonstrate. But
                        maintaining a personal Organizing System with these web applications
                        potentially augments the individual's purpose with social goals like
                        conveying information to others, developing a community, or promoting a
                        reputation. Furthermore, because these community or collaborative
                        applications aggregate and share the tags applied by individuals, they shape
                        the individual Organizing Systems embedded within them when they suggest the
                        most frequent tags for a particular resource.</para>
                </footnote></para>
            <para>Put another way, an information resource inherently has more potential uses than
                resources like <hardware>forks</hardware> or <hardware>frying pans</hardware>, so it

            <para>When the scale of the collection or the number of intended users increases, not
                everyone is likely to share the same goals and design preferences for the Organizing
                System. If you share a kitchen with housemates, you might have to negotiate and
                compromise on some of the decisions about how the kitchen is organized so you can
                all get along. In more formal or institutional Organizing Systems conflicts between
                stakeholders can be much more severe, and the organizing principles might even be
                specified in commercial contracts or governed by law. For example, Bowker and Star
                note that physicians view the creation of patient records as central to diagnosis
                and treatment, insurance companies think of them as evidence needed for payment and
                reimbursement, and researchers think of them as primary data. Not surprisingly,

                <title>Library {and, or, vs.} Business Organizing Systems</title>
                <para>Any information-driven enterprise must have processes and technologies in
                    place that govern information creation or capture and then manage its entire
                    life cycle. In addition to the Organizing Systems that manage and provide access
                    to their collections, large libraries also need business Organizing Systems to
                    support acquisition, billing, interlibrary loan record routing and systems,
                    licenses of digital resources from publishers, course material websites, and the
                    library's own web presence. Commercial firms need processes for transacting with
                    customers or other firms to carry out business operations, to support research
                    and innovation, and to develop business strategy and tactics in compliance with
                    laws and regulations for accounting, taxes, human resources, data retention, and
                    so on. In large firms these functions are so highly specialized and complex that
                    the different types of Organizing Systems have distinct names: <indexterm>

                    important functions in the Organizing Systems of large enterprises are those
                    that manage the information resources needed for its business operation, these
                    firms might also need to maintain corporate libraries and archives.</para>

                Businesses and governmental agencies are usually required by law to keep records of
                financial transactions, decision-making, personnel matters, and other information
                essential to business continuity, compliance with regulations and legal procedures,
                and transparency. As with archives, it is sometimes critical that these business
                knowledge or records management systems can retrieve the original documents,
                although digital copies that can be authenticated are increasingly being accepted as

            <para>Not all resources should be accorded the same degree of organization. In this
                section we will briefly unpack this notion of degree of organization into three
                important and related dimensions: the amount of description or organization applied
                to each resource, the amount of organization of resources into classes or
                categories, and the overall extent to which interactions in and between organizing
                systems are shaped by resource description and arrangement. <xref
                    linkend="chapter-4" xrefstyle="short"/> and <xref linkend="chapter-6"
                    xrefstyle="short"/>, more thoroughly address these questions about the nature
                and extent of description in Organizing Systems.</para>
            <para>Not all resources in a collection require the same degree of description for the
                simple reason we discussed in <xref linkend="section-1.3.3"/>: Organizing Systems
                exist for different purposes and to support different kinds of interactions or
                functions. Let's contrast two ends of the <quote>degree of description</quote>
                continuum. Many people use <quote>current events awareness</quote> or <quote>news
                    feed</quote> applications that select news stories whose titles or abstracts
                contain one or more keywords. This exact match algorithm is easy to implement, but
                its all-or-none and one-item-at-a-time comparison misses any stories that use
                synonyms of the keyword, that are written in languages different from that of the
                keyword, or that are otherwise relevant but do not contain the exact keyword in the
                limited part of the document that is scanned. However, users with current events
                awareness goals do not need to see every news story about some event, and this
                limited amount of description for each story and the simple method of comparing
                descriptions are sufficient.</para>
            <para>On the other hand, this simple Organizing System is inadequate for the purpose of
                comprehensive retrieval of all documents that relate to some concept, event, or
                problem. This is a critical task for scholars, scientists, inventors, physicians,
                attorneys and similar professionals who might need to discover every relevant
                document in some domain. Instead, this type of Organizing System needs rich
                bibliographic and semantic description of each document, most likely assigned by
                professional catalogers, and probably using terms from a <firstterm><glossterm
                        linkend="gloss_controlled_vocabulary">controlled
                    vocabulary</glossterm></firstterm> to enforce consistency in what descriptions
                mean.</para>
            <para><indexterm>
                    <primary>SKU</primary>
                </indexterm>Similarly, different merchants or firms might make different decisions
                about the extent or granularity of description when they assign
                <abbrev>SKU</abbrev>s because of differences in suppliers, targeted customers, or
                other business strategies. If you take your car to the repair shop because
                windshield wiper fluid is leaking, you might be dismayed to find that the broken
                    <hardware>rubber seal</hardware> that is causing the leak cannot be ordered
                separately and you have to pay to replace the <quote><hardware>wiper fluid
                        reservoir</hardware></quote> for which the seal is a minor but vital part.
                Likewise, when two business applications try to exchange and merge customer
                information, integration problems will arise if one describes a customer as a single
                    <quote>NAME</quote> component while the other separates the customer's name into
                    <quote>TITLE,</quote>
                <quote>FIRSTNAME,</quote> and <quote>LASTNAME.</quote></para>
            <para>Even when faced with the same collection of resources, people differ in how much
                organization they prefer or how much disorganization they can tolerate. A classic
                study by <personname>

                categories, while pilers have messy work areas and make few attempts at
                organization. This contrast has analogues in other Organizing Systems and we can

            <para>Different preferences and disagreements between stakeholders in an Organizing

                economic ones. Physicians prefer narrative descriptions and broad classification
                systems because they make it easier to create patient notes. In contrast, insurance
                companies and researchers want fine-grained <quote>form-filling</quote> descriptions
                and detailed classifications that would make the physician's work more

                        modern library cataloging. In 1841 <link id="cite_Panizzi1841"
                            linkend="Panizzi1841">(Panizzi 1841)</link> published 91 cataloging
                        rules for the British Library that defined authoritative forms for titles
                        and author names, but the complexity of the rules and the resulting resource
                        descriptions were widely criticized. For example, the famous author and
                        historian Thomas Carlyle argued that a library catalog should be nothing
                        more than a list of the names of the books in it. Standards for
                        bibliographic description are essential if resources are to be shared
                        between libraries. See <link id="cite_Denton2007" linkend="Denton2007"
                            >(Denton 2007)</link>, (<link linkend="Anderson2001a"

                </footnote></para>
            <para>An alternative and complement to man-made descriptions for each resource are
                computer-generated indexes of their textual contents. These indexes typically assign
                weights to the terms according to calculations that consider the frequency and
                distribution of the terms in both individual documents and in the collection as a
                whole to create a description of what the documents are about. These descriptions of
                the documents in the collection are more consistent than those created by human
                organizers. They allow for more complex query processing and comparison operations
                by the retrieval functions in the Organizing System. For example, query expansion
                mechanisms or thesauri can automatically add synonyms and related terms to the
                search. Additionally, retrieved documents can be arranged by relevance, while
                    <quote>citing</quote> and <quote>cited-by</quote> links can be analyzed to find
                related relevant documents.</para>
            <para>A second constraint on the degree of organization comes from the size of the
                collection within the scope of the Organizing System. Organizing more resources
                requires more descriptions to distinguish any particular resource from the rest, and
                more constraining organizing principles. Similar resources need to be grouped or
                classified to emphasize the most important distinctions among the complete set of
                resources in the collection. A small neighborhood restaurant might have a short wine
                list with just ten wines, arranged in two categories for <quote>red</quote> and
                    <quote>white</quote> and described only by the wine's name and price. In
                contrast, a gourmet restaurant might have hundreds of wines in its wine list, which
                would subdivide its <quote>red</quote> and <quote>white</quote> high-level
                categories into subcategories for country, region of origin, and grape varietal. The
                description for each wine might in addition include a specific vineyard from which
                the grapes were sourced, the vintage year, ratings of the wine, and tasting
                notes.</para>
            <para>At some point a collection grows so large that it is not economically feasible for
                people to create bibliographic descriptions or to classify each separate resource,
                unless there are so many users of the collection that their aggregated effort is
                comparably large; this is organizing by <quote>crowdsourcing.</quote> (See the
                Sidebar on <quote>Web 2.0</quote> in <xref linkend="section-1.3.6" xrefstyle="short"
                />). This leaves two approaches that can be done separately or in tandem. The
                simpler approach is to describe sets of resources or documents as a set or group,
                which is especially sensible for archives with its emphasis on the <glossterm

                </indexterm>Finally, we must acknowledge the ways in which information processing
                and telecommunications technologies have transformed and will continue to transform
                Organizing Systems in every sphere of economic and intellectual activity. A century
                ago, when the telegraph and telephone enabled rapid communication and business
                coordination across large distances, these new technologies enabled the creation of
                massive vertically integrated industrial firms. In the 1920s the Ford Motor Company
                owned coal and iron mines, rubber plantations, railroads, and steel mills so it
                could manage every resource needed in automobile production and reduce the costs and
                uncertainties of finding suppliers, negotiating with them, and ensuring their
                contractual compliance. Adam's Smith's invisible hand of the market as an organizing
                mechanism had been replaced by the visible hand of hierarchical management to
                control what Ronald Coase in 1937 termed <quote>transaction costs</quote> in <link

                effectively free bandwidth, and the Internet<symbol>&#8212;</symbol>have turned
                Coase upside down, leading to entirely new forms of industrial organization made
                possible as transaction costs plummet. When computation and coordination costs drop
                dramatically, it becomes possible for small firms and networks of services (provided
                by people or by computational processes) to out-compete large corporations through
                more efficient use of information resources and services, and through more effective
                information exchange with suppliers and customers, much of it automated. Herbert
                Simon, a pioneer in artificial intelligence, decision making, and human-computer
                interaction, recognized the similarities between the design of computing systems and
                human organizations and developed principles and mechanisms that could apply to
                    both.<footnote id="chapter-1-endnote-25a" role="Citation">

        <title>Organizing This Book</title>
        <para>Devising concepts, methods, and technologies for describing and organizing resources
            have been essential human activities for millennia, evolving both in response to human
            needs and to enable new ones. Organizing Systems enabled the development of
            civilization, from agriculture and commerce to government and warfare. Today Organizing
            Systems are embedded in every domain of purposeful activity, including research,
            education, law, medicine, business, science, institutional memory, sociocultural memory,
            governance, public accountability, as well as in the ordinary acts of daily
            living.</para>
        <para>With the World Wide Web and ubiquitous digital information, along with effectively
            unlimited processing, storage and communication capability, millions of people create
            and browse websites, blog, tag, tweet, and upload and download content of all media
            types without thinking <quote>I'm organizing now</quote> or <quote>I'm retrieving
                now.</quote> Writing a book used to mean a long period of isolated work by an author
            followed by the publishing of a completed artifact, but today some books are
            continuously and iteratively written and published through the online interactions of
            authors and readers. When people use their <hardware>smart phones</hardware> to search
            the web or run applications, location information transmitted from their phone is used
            to filter and reorganize the information they retrieve. Arranging results to make them
            fit the user's location is a kind of computational curation, but because it takes place
            quickly and automatically we hardly notice it.</para>
        <para>Likewise, almost every application that once seemed predominantly about information
            retrieval is now increasingly combined with activities and functions that most would
            consider to be information organization. <orgname>Google</orgname>,
                <orgname>Microsoft</orgname>, and other search engine operators have deployed
            millions of computers to analyze billions of web pages and millions of books and
            documents to enable the almost instantaneous retrieval of published or archival
            information. However, these firms increasingly augment this retrieval capability with
            information services that organize information in close to real-time. Further, the
            selection and presentation of search results, advertisements, and other information can
            be tailored for the person searching for information using his implicit or explicit
            preferences, location, or other <glossterm linkend="gloss_contextual_properties"

                <primary>tradeoffs</primary>
                <secondary>organization versus retrieval</secondary>
            </indexterm>Taken together, these innovations in technology and its application mean
            that the distinction between <quote>information organization</quote> and
                <quote>information retrieval</quote> that is often manifested in academic
            disciplines and curricula is much less important than it once was. This book has few
            sharp divisions between <quote>information organization</quote> (<abbrev>IO</abbrev>)
            and <quote>information retrieval</quote> (<abbrev>IR</abbrev>) topics. Instead, it
            explains the key concepts and challenges in the design and deployment of Organizing
            Systems in a way that continuously emphasizes the relationships and tradeoffs between
                <abbrev>IO</abbrev> and <abbrev>IR</abbrev>. The concept of the Organizing System
            highlights the design dimensions and decisions that collectively determine the extent
            and nature of resource organization and the capabilities of the processes that compare,
            combine, transform and interact with the organized resources.</para>
        <highlights>
            <para><emphasis role="strong"><xref linkend="chapter-2"/>.</emphasis> Developing a view
                that brings together how we organize as individuals with how libraries, museums,
                governments, research institutions, and businesses create Organizing Systems
                requires that we generalize the organizing concepts and methods from these different
                domains. <xref linkend="chapter-2" xrefstyle="short"/> surveys a wide variety of
                Organizing Systems and describes four activities or functions shared by all of them:
                selecting resources, organizing resources, designing resource-based interactions and
                services, and maintaining resources over time.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="strong"><xref linkend="chapter-3"/>.</emphasis> The design of an
                Organizing System is strongly shaped by what is being organized, the first of the
                five design decisions we introduced earlier in <xref linkend="section-1.3.2"/>. To
                enable a broad perspective on this fundamental issue we use <glossterm
                    linkend="gloss_resource">resource</glossterm> to refer to anything being
                organized, an abstraction that we can apply to physical things, digital things,
                information about either of them, or web-based services or objects. <xref
                    linkend="chapter-3" xrefstyle="short"/> discusses the challenges and methods for
                identifying the resources in an Organizing System in great detail and emphasizes how
                these decisions reflect the goals and interactions that must be
                    supported<symbol>&#8212;</symbol>the <quote>why</quote> design decisions
                introduced in <xref linkend="section-1.3.3"/>.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="strong"><xref linkend="chapter-4"/>.</emphasis> The principles by
                which resources are organized and the kinds of services and interactions that can be
                supported for them largely depend on the nature and explicitness of the resource
                descriptions. This <quote>how much description</quote> design question was
                introduced in <xref linkend="section-1.3.4"/>; <xref linkend="chapter-4"
                    xrefstyle="short"/> presents a systematic process for creating effective
                descriptions and analyzes how this general approach can be adapted for different
                types of Organizing Systems.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="strong"><xref linkend="chapter-5"/>.</emphasis> An important
                aspect of organizing a collection of resources is describing the relationships
                between them. <xref linkend="chapter-5" xrefstyle="short"/> introduces the
                specialized vocabulary used to describe semantic relationships between resources and
                between the concepts and words used in resource descriptions. It also discusses the
                structural relationships within multipart resources and between resources, like
                those expressed as citations or hypertext links.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="strong"><xref linkend="chapter-6"/>.</emphasis> Groups or sets of
                resources with similar or identical descriptions can be treated as equivalent,
                making them members of an <emphasis>equivalence class</emphasis> or <emphasis
                    role="italic">category</emphasis>. Identifying and using categories are
                essential human activities that take place automatically for perceptual categories
                like <quote>red things</quote> or <quote>round things.</quote> Categorization is
                deeply ingrained in language and culture, and we use linguistic and cultural
                categories without realizing it, but categorization can also be a deeply analytic
                and cognitive process. <xref linkend="chapter-6" xrefstyle="short"/> reviews
                theories of categorization from the point of view of how categories are created and
                used in Organizing Systems.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="strong"><xref linkend="chapter-7"/>.</emphasis> The terms
                    <emphasis>categorization</emphasis> and <emphasis>classification</emphasis> are

                <xref linkend="chapter-7" xrefstyle="short"/> discusses the broad range of how
                classifications are used in Organizing Systems. These include enumerative
                classification, faceted classification, activity-based classification, and
                computational classification. Because classification and standardization are closely
                related, the chapter also analyzes standards and standards-making as they apply to
                Organizing Systems.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="strong"><xref linkend="chapter-8"/>.</emphasis>
                <xref linkend="chapter-8" xrefstyle="short"/> complements the conceptual and
                methodological perspective on the creation of resource descriptions with an
                implementation perspective. <xref linkend="chapter-8" xrefstyle="short"/> reviews a
                range of metamodels for structuring descriptions, with particular emphasis on
                    <abbrev>XML</abbrev>, <abbrev>JSON</abbrev>, and <abbrev>RDF</abbrev>. It
                concludes by comparing and contrasting three <quote>worlds of description</quote>
                <symbol>&#8212;</symbol>document processing, the web, and the <glossterm
                    linkend="gloss_semantic_web">Semantic

                appropriate.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="strong"><xref linkend="chapter-9"/>.</emphasis> When Organizing
                Systems overlap, intersect, or are combined (temporarily or permanently),
                differences in resource descriptions can make it difficult or impossible to locate
                resources, access them, or otherwise impair their use. <xref linkend="chapter-9"
                    xrefstyle="short"/> reviews some of the great variety of concepts and techniques
                that different domains use when interacting with resources in Organizing
                    Systems<symbol>&#8212;</symbol>integration, interoperability, data mapping,
                crosswalks, mashups, and so on. Similarly, processes for information retrieval are often characterized
                as comparing the description of a user's needs with descriptions of the resources
                that might satisfy them. <xref linkend="chapter-9" xrefstyle="short"/> extends and

                made in different phases in an Organizing System's life cycle. System life cycle
                models exhibit great variety, but we use a generic four-phase model that
                distinguishes a domain identification and scoping phase, a requirements phase, a
                design and implementation phase, and an operational phase. This model is then used
                to guide the analysis of four case studies that span the range of Organizing
                Systems.</para>
